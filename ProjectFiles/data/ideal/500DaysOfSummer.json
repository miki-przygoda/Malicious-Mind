(406) int. apartment - later tom, almost with a full beard, is redecorating his apartment again. we see him rearranging the furniture in the room. later. he hangs some new pictures. later. he uses a pencil on the wall to mark for a bookshelf. then he uses a ruler to make sure his marks are even. he draws a faint line on the wall to mark where he needs to nail something. 104. (240) int coffee house - later that day again. as we've seen before, tom reads a newspaper. summer reads a novel. tom it's playing at 5. summer you want to go? tom i don't know. you wanna maybe go back to your place or --- summer i want to see it. let's go. tom ok cool. summer unless you don't want to. tom no, i will. that's fine. summer ok. a few more silent beats. something's in the air. int movie - later tom and summer watching the film. tears begin to well in summer's eyes. they soon turn to audible sobs. tom turns to look at her, to offer some sort of comfort, believing it to be a response to the movie. she doesn't look back. (409) int tom's bedroom - day tom drawing a straight line on his wall. redecorating. 105. and then he stops. he looks at the line he's drawn. he extends it a little bit. he draws another. he begins to furiously draw on the wall. from out of nowhere, inspiration has hit. an image starts to form. a pretty impressive looking futuristic skyscraper, almost shaped like a tear drop. (240) ext movie theatre - later same day from the past. they walk out, at first everything's alright. it's exactly as we saw on page 7. but soon after that she begins to cry again. serious, real sobbing. tom hey. he goes to hug her. he hugs her. it's unclear if she hugs back. tom hey sum, it's just a movie. summer i know. i'm sorry tom. tom is everything alright with you? she smiles, tries to pull herself together. summer yeah. i'm just...i'm sorry. i'm being ridiculous. tom it's ok. this happens to me every time i watch hoosiers. let's go for a walk, ok. let's get some air. or go to sister ray's. summer ok. they walk. 106. int record store - night tom and a much more in control summer walk down the aisles. he grabs one. tom it pains me that we live in a world where no one's ever heard of spearmint. summer i've never heard of them. tom and it's painful. oh look. he grabs a ringo starr album and shows it to her, just as we've seen on page 7. she smiles and they continue on down the aisles. in cu, tom goes to hold summer's hand. but something happens. it could be a total coincidence, but just as his hand approaches hers (in slo-mo), she moves it away and keeps it at her side. tom puts his hands in his pockets, unsure if there's something to read in that. (411) ext harbor - day tom sketches intensely. the landscape, the skyline, the works. he's in the zone. (240) ext record store - later again, that fateful day continues. tom and summer outside. summer so. tom so... now what? 107. summer now...i think i'm gonna call it a day. tom yeah? you wanna maybe...get some dinner or something? summer i've got pasta at home. tom are you hungry? summer i'm pretty hungry, but -- tom ooh! summer what? tom i've got a great idea! summer what? tom let's get breakfast. summer now? tom pancakes? summer's resistance is futile. and the rest as they say is history. fade up: number two by the pernice brothers. which plays over: (417-464) 1. int tom's bathroom - day tom shaves. makes himself look presentable. 108. later. tom, now clean shaven and looking like he did when we first met him, sketches on his bed with one hand while holding a phone with the other. 2. ext city sidewalk - day tom sits on a street corner drawing new additions to the city's skyline. 2. int library - day tom sits with his feet up on a table, headphones on his ears, reading one of many taschen books on innovative building design. 3. int office lobby - day tom drops off his portfolio with the security guard in the lobby of a high-rise. 4. ext soccer field - day tom and his mom and step-dad cheer on his sister playing soccer. it's a nice temporary distraction for him. 6. int tom's bedroom - day tom getting bad news on the phone. he has a list written on his wall (which is now composed of a dynamic cityscape of futuristic looking structures). he crosses abrams and abrams off the list. we notice several others are also crossed off. 5. ext golden gate bridge - day tom has his car on the side of the road and is out measuring the distance between the beams of the bridge. 8. ext park - day tom jogs. a little faster this time. 9. int tom's bedroom - night tom getting more bad news from the answering machine, crossing off yet another firm from the list. few remain. he sits on the bed with his shoulders slumped. for a beat, lost in thought. 109."

(478) ext office building - another day tom, in a suit, exits a building after another dismal interview. we can see he is frustrated but not deterred. in the distance, his favorite spot in the city, where he took summer ages ago. ext. park - day tom walks over and sits down on a bench. he stares off, lost in thought. and then, from out of nowhere, there's her voice. summer (v.o.) hey. summer sits like an apparition on a neighboring bench. she may have just sat down, she may have been there for hours. tom isn't sure if she's real. he doesn't quite know what to do. summer (re: suit) where you coming from? tom what? oh. nowhere. how long have you been sitting there? summer awhile. tom finds it hard to look at her. 110. summer i come here a lot. i always loved this place, ever since you brought me here. the mention of their past makes the atmosphere frosty. tom so... i should probably say congratulations. summer probably. but only if you mean it. tom i don't know if i do honestly. summer i understand. tom yeah well...anyway...i hope you're happy. summer you really do? tom (beat) god no. they both laugh a little. the tension begins to dissipate. summer how are you, tom? tom i'm good. ish. summer that's good. tom yeah i quit the office. summer really? that's great! what are you doing now? tom mostly...sleeping. breaking things. awkward silence. 111. tom so who's the guy? summer who, my guy? tom yeah... wait. don't tell me. i don't want to know. summer tom... tom no really, i don't. summer ok. more awkward silence. this one goes on a beat longer. and then: tom it's amazing to me. you're married. summer i know. tom you're not only someone's girlfriend, your someone's wife! summer pretty crazy, huh? tom (sighs) i'll never understand that. summer tom -- tom what's different now? how could things change so quickly? summer i don't know. it just happened. tom what happened?! that's what i don't get. 112. summer i... tom... tom what, tell me... summer i woke up one day and i knew. tom says nothing. summer i knew i could promise him i'd feel the same way every morning. in a way that i... i never could with you. and there's not much else to say after that. tom gets up to leave. tom you know what sucks? realizing that everything you believe in is complete bullshit. summer what is? tom destiny, soulmates, true love. all that stuff. it's nothing more than silly childhood fairy tale nonsense, isn't it? god! summer tom, don't go. tom i should have listened to you, summer. you were right all along. summer takes a beat to let this hang there. summer i was right? and then, out of nowhere, she begins to hysterically laugh. tom what? this is funny? 113. tries to stop but it only makes it worse. now's she's completely cracking up. tom what are you laughing at? and she can't stop. she's totally lost control. tom (trying himself not to laugh) you're a crazy person! summer tom! you're the crazy person! tom what are you talking about?! summer one day i'm reading a book at the corner deli and this guy sits down and starts asking about it. now he's my husband! tom this is funny to you? summer what would have happened if i went to the movies instead? if i went somewhere else for lunch? if i showed up to eat ten minutes later? tom, it was meant to be, just like you said. and as it was happening, i knew it. i could feel it, sure as the sun. and i kept thinking to myself holy shit. tom was right. you were right about all of it. (beat) it just wasn't me you were right about. tom is speechless. summer takes his hand. we may notice her wedding ring. we may also notice that this is the same exact shot as the first scene of the screenplay. we hold it for a few seconds more. and then, the hands separate. summer anyway, i should probably be getting back. it was good to see you. i'm glad you're well. 114. summer gets up and starts walking away from him. after a second: tom summer! she stops and turns back. he takes in her face, most likely for the last time ever. tom i really do hope you're happy. summer i know. (beat) see you later. and she walks away. the camera tracks away with her, leaving tom alone in the park, getting smaller and farther away every second. fade out: a few seconds of black, before... fade in: (500) int office waiting area - day tom, in a suit, with a hefty batch of architecture sketches at his side, waits in the foyer of allen, prince, and gethers architecture. from the room we can tell this firm is big time. tom waits. we notice, before he does, a very cute girl sitting in a another chair, also waiting. she smiles. he smiles back. girl are you here to interview? tom sorry? 115. girl are you interviewing? for the position? tom oh."
